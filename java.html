      <h3>What is Java?</h3>
      <p>Java is a programming language and a platform. Java is a high level, robust, object-oriented and
        secure programming language.<br/>
        Java was developed by Sun Microsystems (which is now the subsidiary of Oracle) in the year 1995.
        <span id="founder">James Gosling</span>   is known as the father of Java.<br/>
        <span id="oop">  Platform</span>: Any hardware or software environment in which a program runs, is known as a platform.
         Since Java has a runtime environment (JRE) and API, it is called a platform.<br/>
         In the late 1970's Bill Joy thought about doing a language that would merge the best features of MESA and C.<br/>
         In 1989 Joy sold his Sun stock, invested heavily in Microsoft and moved out of mainstream Sun to Aspen, Colorado.
         By the early 90's Bill was getting tired of huge programs.<br/>
        In late 1990 Bill wrote a paper called Further which outlined his pitch to Sun engineers
        that they should produce an object environment based on C++.<br/>
        In April of 1991 the Green Project (Naughton, Gosling and Sheridan) settled on smart consumer
        electronics as the delivery platform, and Gosling started working in earnest on Oak. <br/>
        In early 1993 the Green team heard about a Time-Warner request for proposal for a settop box operating system.
        First Person quickly shifted focus from smart consumer electronics <br/>(which was proving to be more hype than reality)
        to the set-top box OS market, and placed a bid with Time-Warner. <br/>
        Without a market to be seen First Person was rolled back into Sun in 1994.<br/>
        However around this time it was realized that the requirements for smart consumer electronics and settop box software<br/>
        (small, platform independent secure reliable code) were the same requirements for the nascent web.

       <h3>What is OOP: Object-oriented programming? </h3>
       <p>It is a programming model that treats programming from a perspective where each component is
         considered an object, with its own properties and methods, <br/>
         replacing or complementing structured programming paradigm,
          where the focus was on procedures and parameters.</p>
