            <h3>What is Python?</h3>
            <p>Python is an object-oriented, high-level programming language with integrated dynamic semantics primarily<br/>
               for web and app development. It is extremely attractive in the field of Rapid Application Development<br/>
                because it offers dynamic typing and dynamic binding options.<br/>
                First developed in the late 1980s by<span id="founder"> Guido van Rossum</span>,
                 Python has advanced as an open source programming language.<br/>
               The language was finally released in 1991. When it was released, it used a lot fewer codes to express the concepts<br/>
               Those new to programming can benefit from Python's high level of abstraction. <br/>
               It is highly interactive and known for its "strong opinions" around specific syntax (including whitespace).<br/>
             Python, like other high-level languages, has a garbage collection process to manage memory or delete unused resources.<br/>
             A user can receive instant feedback from the interpreter by typing python on the command line</br>
              or by using projects like JupyterLab if they want a browser-based development experience. <br/>
              Many users also appreciate that Python has a strict syntax enforced by the compiler, <br/>
              making it easy to have a single "right way" to write a program. 
             </p>
             <h3>What is OOP: Object-oriented programming? </h3>
             <p>It is a programming model that treats programming from a perspective where each component is
               considered an object, with its own properties and methods, <br/>
               replacing or complementing structured programming paradigm,
                where the focus was on procedures and parameters.</p>
