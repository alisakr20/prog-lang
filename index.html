            <strong>A programming language </strong> is a vocabulary and set of grammatical rules for
            instructing a computer or computing device to perform specific tasks.
          </p>
          <p>
            The term programming language usually refers to high-level languages,
            such as:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>BASIC</li>
            <li>C</li>
            <li>C++</li>
            <li>C#</li>
            <li>Java</li>
            <li>Python</li>
            <li>PHP</li>
            <li>Pascal</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Each programming language has a unique set of keywords (words that it
            understands) and a special syntax for organizing program instructions.
          </p>

        <tr>
          <td>Compiled languages are converted directly into machine code that the processor can execute. As a result, they tend to be faster and more efficient to execute than interpreted languages. They also give the developer more control over hardware aspects, like memory management and CPU usage.</td>
          <td>Interpreters run through a program line by line and execute each command. Here, if the author decides he wants to use a different kind of olive oil, he could scratch the old one out and add the new one. Your translator friend can then convey that change to you as it happens.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td> Compiled languages need a “build” step – they need to be manually compiled first. You need to “rebuild” the program every time you need to make a change. In our hummus example, the entire translation is written before it gets to you. If the original author decides that he wants to use a different kind of olive oil, the entire recipe would need to be translated again and resent to you.</td>
          <td>Interpreted languages were once significantly slower than compiled languages. But, with the development of <a href="https://guide.freecodecamp.org/computer-science/just-in-time-compilation" >just-in-time compilation</a>, that gap is shrinking.</td>
