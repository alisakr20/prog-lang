      <h3>What is C++?</h3>
      <p>C++ is a programming language. It literally means "increased C",
        reflecting its nature as an evolution of the C language.<br>
       has a history going back to 1979, when <span id="founder">Bjarne Stroustrup</span>  began work on "C with Classes"
       to add <span id="oop">object-oriented programming</span> into the C language.
       <br/>
       In 1983, the name of the language was changed from C with Classes to C++.<br/>
       In 1985, Stroustrup's reference to the language entitled The C++ Programming Language was
       published.<br/>
       In 1990, The Annotated C++ Reference Manual was released. The same year,
       Borland's Turbo C++ compiler would be released as a commercial product.<br/>
       In 1998,  the C++ standards committee published the first international standard for C++
       ISO/IEC 14882:1998,  which would be informally known as C++98.<br/>
       In 2005, the C++ standards committee released a technical report (dubbed TR1) detailing various features they were
       planning to add to the latest C++ standard.<br/>
       In mid-2011, the new C++ standard (dubbed C++11) was finished.

       <h3>What is OOP: Object-oriented programming? </h3>
       <p>It is a programming model that treats programming from a perspective where each component is
         considered an object, with its own properties and methods, <br/>
         replacing or complementing structured programming paradigm,
          where the focus was on procedures and parameters.</p>
