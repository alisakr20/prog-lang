      <h3>What is PHP?</h3>
      <p>PHP is a server side scripting language. that is used to develop Static websites or Dynamic websites or Web applications.<br/>
         PHP stands for Hypertext Pre-processor, that earlier stood for Personal Home Pages. <br/>
         PHP was written in the C programming language by<span id="founder"> Rasmus Lerdorf </span>in 1994 for use in <br/>
         monitoring his online resume and related personal information.<br/>
         For this reason, PHP originally stood for "Personal Home Page". Lerdorf combined PHP with his own Form Interpreter,<br/>
         releasing the combination publicly as PHP/FI (generally referred to as PHP 2.0) <br/>
         on June 8, 1995. Two programmers, Zeev Suraski and Andi Gutmans, rebuilt PHP's core, <br/>
         releasing the updated result as PHP/FI 2 in 1997. <br/>
         The acronym was formally changed to PHP: HyperText Preprocessor, at this time.<br/>
         (This is an example of a recursive acronym: where the acronym itself is in its own definition.) <br/>
         In 1998, PHP 3 was released, which was the first widely used version. <br/>
         PHP 4 was released in May 2000, with a new core, known as the Zend Engine 1.0. PHP 4 featured improved speed and <br/>
         reliability over PHP 3. In terms of features, PHP 4 added references, the Boolean type, COM support on Windows, <br/>
         output buffering, many new array functions, expanded object-oriented programming, inclusion of the PCRE library,<br/>
          and more. Maintenance releases of PHP 4 are still available, primarily for security updates.

       <h3>What is OOP: Object-oriented programming? </h3>
       <p>It is a programming model that treats programming from a perspective where each component is
         <p>Java is a programming language and a platform. Java is a high level, robust, object-oriented and
         considered an object, with its own properties and methods, <br/>
         replacing or complementing structured programming paradigm,
          where the focus was on procedures and parameters.</p>
